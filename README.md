# Welcome to rest scala/spray/akka/slick/mysql example #

I have created this project during my research on scala/spray/akka/slick/mysql REST service.

It may be used to learn a bit on how to use those technologies to create REST service.
It's just a prove of concept though and it's not production ready. It definitely can be used as a good start.

The database underneath is mysql, but it can be easily switch to any other which is supported by slick.

### System requirements ###

* Mysql server - up and running
* MySQL Connector/J is installed (jdbc driver for mysql) http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
* Java with maven is installed

### Configuration ###

* Set up user and database on mysql server
* Edit db.conf in resources to configure db connection

### Have fun ###
